# react-testing-notebooks
This is a simple notebook that runs in the browser similar to storybooks but the only difference is that it is targetted at working with the react-testing-libary.

To run this project we just need to clone this repository and then run from the terminal the following command
- `npx rtl-book serve roles-notes.js`
- This will start the local server and if needed the terminal might ask to install the needed package to run `rtl-book`
- After the terminal command has been entered the local server and a prompt will be given to navigate to the following url address
- `http://localhost:4005/`
